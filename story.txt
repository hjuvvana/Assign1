Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Matthew,

I am writing to you from a strong spaceship in a hard-working galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a Black rocket in July. There are 5 horses and planes of Ken here! In the
Gateway there is a pool full of Celery juice. I fall asleep each night on a cool bed of
cotton and dream of gym quickly. It feels as though I have lived here for
3 seconds. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
sprint on a hot scooty!!

Best wishes,
Harika.
